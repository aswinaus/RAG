              "\"Based on the provided context, Uber's liquidity can be assessed by looking at its balance sheet. The document mentions the company's assets, including cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, and other current assets, as well as its liabilities and equity. By analyzing these figures, one can determine if Uber has the necessary liquidity to meet its working capital and capital expenditures needs.\\n\\nSpecifically, the document shows that Uber had cash and cash equivalents of $4,680 million and short-term investments of $727 million as of December 31, 2023. These figures indicate that Uber has a significant amount of liquid assets that could potentially cover its short-term financial obligations and capital expenditures.\\n\\nAdditionally, the total assets of Uber were $38,699 million, while the total liabilities were $32,109 million as of December 31, 2023. This suggests that Uber has a healthy equity position, which could further support its liquidity position.\\n\\nIn conclusion, based on the information provided in the document, Uber appears to have the liquidity to meet its working capital and capital expenditures needs, given its substantial cash reserves and overall financial position.\""
