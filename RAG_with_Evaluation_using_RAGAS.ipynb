The facility provided Lyft with financial flexibility to meet its working capital and capital expenditure needs for at least the next 12 months.\\n\\nThe long-term benefits of the revolving credit facility include providing Lyft with access to additional funds when needed, allowing the company to manage its liquidity and cash flow effectively. It also provides a source of financing for potential future investments, acquisitions, or expansion initiatives.
